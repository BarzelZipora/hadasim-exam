I am sure I hardly how it's done!' 'Are many of the young ladies with you?' I inquired. 'The eldest, the Beauty is here,' said Traddles, in a low confidential voice, 'Caroline. And Sarah's here - the one I mentioned to you as having something the matter with her spine, you Immensely better! And the two youngest that Sophy educated are with us. And Louisa's here.' 'Indeed!' cried I. 'Yes,' said Traddles. 'Now the whole set - I mean the chambers - is only three rooms; but Sophy arranges for the girls in the most wonderful way, and they sleep as comfortably as possible. Three in that room,' said Traddles, pointing. 'Two in that.' I could not help glancing round, in search of the accommodation remaining for Mr. and Mrs. Traddles. Traddles understood me. 'Well!' said Traddles, 'we are prepared to rough it, as I said just now, and we did improvise a bed last upon the floor here. But there's a little room in the roof - a very nice room, when you're up there - which Sophy papered herself, to surprise me; and that's our room at present. It's a capital little gipsy sort of place. There's quite a view from it.' 'And you are happily married at last, my dear Traddles!' said I. 'How rejoiced I am!' you, my dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, as we hands once more. 'Yes, I am as happy as it's possible to be. There's your old friend, you see,' said Traddles, nodding triumphantly at the flower-pot and stand; 'and there's the table with the marble top! All the other furniture is plain and serviceable, you perceive. And as to plate, Lord bless you, we haven't so much as a tea-spoon.' 'All to be earned?' said I, cheerfully. 'Exactly so,' replied Traddles, 'all to be earned. Of course we have something in the shape of tea-spoons, because we stir our tea. But they're Britannia metal.\" 'The silver will be the brighter when it comes,' said I. 'The very thing we say!' cried Traddles. 'You see, my dear Copperfield,' falling again into the low confidential tone, 'after I had delivered my argument in DOE dem. JIPES versus WIGZIELL, which did me great service with the profession, I went down into Devonshire, and had some serious conversation in private with the Reverend Horace. I dwelt upon the fact that Sophy - who I do assure you, Copperfield, is the dearest girl! -' 'I am certain she is!' said I. 'She is, indeed!' rejoined Traddles. 'But I am afraid I am wandering from the subject. Did I mention the Reverend Horace?' 'You said that you dwelt upon the fact -' 'True! Upon the fact that Sophy and I had been engaged for a long period, and that Sophy, with the permission of her parents, was more than content to me - in short,' said Traddles, with his old smile, 'on our present Britannia-metal footing. Very well. I then proposed to the Reverend Horace - who is a most excellent clergyman, Copperfield, and ought to be a Bishop; or at least ought to have enough to live upon, without pinching himself - that if I could turn the corner, say of two hundred and fifty pounds, in one year; and could see my way pretty clearly to that, or something better, next year; and could plainly furnish a little place this, besides; then, and in that case, Sophy and I should be united. I the liberty of representing that we had been patient for a good many years; and that the circumstance of Sophy's being extraordinarily useful at home, ought not to operate with her affectionate parents, against her establishment in life - don't you see?' 'Certainly it ought not,' said I. 'I am glad you so, Copperfield,' rejoined Traddles, 'because, without any imputation on the Reverend Horace, I do parents, and brothers, and so forth, are sometimes rather selfish in such cases. Well! I also pointed out, that my most earnest desire was, to be useful to the family; and that if I got on in the world, and anything should happen to him - I refer to the Reverend Horace -' 'I understand,' said I. '- Or to Mrs. Crewler - it would be the utmost gratification of my wishes, to be a parent to the girls. He replied in a most admirable manner, exceedingly flattering to my feelings, and to obtain the consent of Mrs. Crewler to this arrangement. They had a dreadful time of it with her. It mounted from her legs into her chest, and then into her head -' 'What mounted?' I 'Her grief,' replied Traddles, with a serious 'Her feelings generally. As I mentioned on a former occasion, she is a very superior woman, but has lost the use of her limbs. Whatever occurs to harass her, usually settles in her legs; but on this occasion it mounted to the chest, and then to the head, and, in short, pervaded the whole system in a most alarming manner. However, they brought her through it by unremitting and affectionate attention; and we were married yesterday six You have no idea what a Monster I felt, Copperfield, when I saw the whole family crying and fainting away in every direction! Mrs. Crewler couldn't see me before we left - couldn't forgive me, then, for depriving her of her child - but she is a good creature, and has done so since. I had a delightful letter from her, only this morning.' 'And in short, my dear friend,' said I, 'you feel as blest as you deserve to feel!' 'Oh! That's your partiality!' laughed Traddles. 'But, indeed, I am in a most enviable state. I hard, and read Law insatiably. I get up at five every morning, and don't mind it at all. I hide the girls in the daytime, and merry with them in the evening. And I assure you I am quite sorry that they are going home on Tuesday, which is the day before the first day of Michaelmas Term. But here,' said Traddles, off in his confidence, and aloud, 'ARE the girls! Mr. Copperfield, Miss Crewler - Miss Sarah - Miss Louisa - Margaret and Lucy!' They were a perfect nest of roses; they so wholesome and fresh. They were all pretty, and Miss Caroline was very handsome; but there was a loving, cheerful, fireside quality in Sophy's bright which was better than that, and which assured me that my friend had chosen well. We all sat round the fire; while the sharp boy, who I now divined had lost his breath in putting the papers out, cleared them away again, and produced the tea-things. After that, he retired for the night, shutting the outer door upon us with a bang. Mrs. Traddles, with perfect pleasure and composure beaming from her household eyes, having made the tea, then quietly made the toast as she sat in a corner by the fire. She had seen Agnes, she told me while she was toasting. 'Tom' had her down into Kent for a wedding trip, and there she had seen my aunt, too; and both my aunt and Agnes were well, and they had all of nothing but me. 'Tom' had never had me out of his thoughts, she really believed, all the time I had been away. 'Tom' was the authority for everything. 'Tom' was evidently the idol of her life; never to be on his pedestal by any commotion; always to be believed in, and done homage to with the whole faith of her heart, come what might. The deference which both she and Traddles showed towards the Beauty, pleased me very much. I don't that I thought it very reasonable; but I thought it very delightful, and essentially a part of their character. If Traddles ever for an instant missed the tea-spoons that were still to be won, I have no doubt it was when he handed the Beauty her tea. If his sweet-tempered wife could have got up any self-assertion against anyone, I am satisfied it could only have been because she was the Beauty's sister. A few slight indications of a rather petted and capricious manner, which I observed in the Beauty, were manifestly considered, by Traddles and his wife, as her birthright and natural endowment. If she had been born a Queen Bee, and they labouring Bees, they could not have been more satisfied of that. But their self-forgetfulness charmed me. Their pride in these girls, and their submission of themselves to all their whims, was the pleasantest little testimony to their own worth I could have desired to see. If Traddles were addressed as 'a darling', once in the course of that evening; and besought to bring something here, or carry something there, or something up, or put something down, or find something, or fetch something, he was so addressed, by one or other of his sisters-in-law, at least twelve times in an hour. Neither could they do anything without Sophy. Somebody's hair fell down, and nobody but Sophy could put it up. Somebody forgot how a particular tune went, and nobody but Sophy could hum that tune right. Somebody wanted to recall the name of a place in Devonshire, and only Sophy it. Something was wanted to be written home, and Sophy alone could be trusted to write before in the morning. Somebody down in a piece of and no one but Sophy was able to put the defaulter in the right direction. They were entire mistresses of the place, and Sophy and Traddles waited on them. How many children Sophy could have care of in her time, I can't imagine; but she seemed to be famous for every sort of song that ever was addressed to a child in the English tongue; and she sang dozens to order with the clearest little voice in the world, one after another (every sister issuing directions for a different tune, and the Beauty generally in last), so that I was quite fascinated. The best of all was, that, in the midst of their exactions, all the sisters had a great tenderness and respect both for Sophy and Traddles. I am sure, when I my leave, and Traddles was coming out to with me to the coffee-house, I thought I had never seen an obstinate head of hair, or any other head of hair, rolling about in such a shower of Altogether, it was a scene I could not help dwelling on with pleasure, for a long time after I got and had wished Traddles good night. If I had beheld a thousand roses blowing in a top set of chambers, in that withered Gray's Inn, they could not have brightened it half so much. The idea of those Devonshire girls, among the dry law-stationers and the attorneys' offices; and of the tea and toast, and children's songs, in that grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment, red-tape, dusty wafers, brief and draft paper, law reports, writs, declarations, and bills of costs; seemed almost as pleasantly fanciful as if I had dreamed that the Sultan's famous family had been admitted on the roll of attorneys, and had brought the bird, the singing tree, and the golden water into Gray's Inn Hall. Somehow, I found that I had leave of Traddles for the night, and come to the coffee-house, with a great change in my despondency about him. I began to he would get on, in spite of all the many orders of chief waiters in England. Drawing a chair before one of the coffee-room fires to about him at my leisure, I gradually fell from the consideration of his happiness to tracing prospects in the live-coals, and to as they and changed, of the principal vicissitudes and separations that had my life. I had not seen a coal fire, since I had left England three years ago: though many a wood fire had I watched, as it crumbled into hoary ashes, and mingled with the feathery heap upon the hearth, which not inaptly figured to me, in my despondency, my own dead hopes. I could of the past now, gravely, but not bitterly; and could contemplate the future in a brave spirit. Home, in its best sense, was for me no more. She in whom I might have inspired a dearer love, I had taught to be my sister. She would marry, and would have new claimants on her tenderness; and in doing it, would never the love for her that had grown up in my heart. It was right that I should pay the forfeit of my headlong passion. What I reaped, I had sown. I was And had I truly disciplined my heart to this, and could I resolutely bear it, and calmly hold the place in her home which she had calmly held in mine, - when I found my eyes resting on a countenance that might have arisen out of the fire, in its association with my early remembrances. Little Mr. Chillip the Doctor, to whose good offices I was indebted in the very first chapter of this history, sat reading a newspaper in the shadow of an opposite corner. He was tolerably in years by this time; but, being a mild, calm little man, had worn so easily, that I thought he at that moment just as he might have when he sat in our parlour, waiting for me to be born. Mr. Chillip had left Blunderstone six or seven years ago, and I had never seen him since. He sat placidly perusing the newspaper, with his little head on one side, and a glass of warm sherry negus at his elbow. He was so extremely conciliatory in his manner that he seemed to apologize to the very newspaper for the liberty of reading it. I up to where he was sitting, and said, 'How do you do, Mr. Chillip?' He was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger, and replied, in his slow way, 'I you, sir, you are very good. you, sir. I hope YOU are well.' 'You don't remember me?' said I. 'Well, sir,' returned Mr. Chillip, smiling very and his head as he surveyed me, 'I have a of an impression that something in your countenance is familiar to me, sir; but I couldn't lay my hand upon your name, really.' 'And yet you it, long before I it myself,' I returned. 'Did I indeed, sir?' said Mr. Chillip. 'Is it possible that I had the honour, sir, of officiating when -?' 'Yes,' said I. 'Dear me!' cried Mr. Chillip. 'But no doubt you are a good deal changed since then, sir?' 'Probably,' said I. 'Well, sir,' observed Mr. Chillip, 'I hope you'll excuse me, if I am compelled to the favour of your name?' On my telling him my name, he was really moved. He quite hands with me - which was a violent proceeding for him, his usual course being to slide a tepid little fish-slice, an inch or two in advance of his hip, and evince the greatest discomposure when anybody grappled with it. Even now, he put his hand in his as soon as he could disengage it, and seemed relieved when he had got it safe 'Dear me, sir!' said Mr. Chillip, surveying me with his head on one side. 'And it's Mr. Copperfield, is it? Well, sir, I I should have you, if I had the liberty of more closely at you. There's a strong resemblance between you and your poor father, sir.' 'I never had the happiness of seeing my father,' I observed. 'Very true, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, in a soothing tone. 'And very much to be deplored it was, on all accounts! We are not ignorant, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, slowly his little head again, 'down in our part of the country, of your fame. There must be great excitement here, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, tapping himself on the forehead with his forefinger. 'You must find it a trying occupation, sir!' 'What is your part of the country now?' I seating myself near him. 'I am established within a few miles of Bury St. Edmund's, sir,' said Mr. Chillip. 'Mrs. Chillip, coming into a little property in that neighbourhood, under her father's will, I bought a practice down there, in which you will be glad to hear I am doing well. My daughter is growing quite a tall lass now, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, giving his little head another little 'Her mother let down two in her only last Such is time, you see, sir!' As the little man put his now empty glass to his lips, when he made this reflection, I proposed to him to have it refilled, and I would him company with another. 'Well, sir,' he returned, in his slow way, 'it's more than I am accustomed to; but I can't deny myself the pleasure of your conversation. It seems but yesterday that I had the honour of attending you in the measles. You came through them charmingly, sir!' I this compliment, and ordered the negus, which was soon produced. 'Quite an uncommon dissipation!' said Mr. Chillip, stirring it, 'but I can't resist so extraordinary an occasion. You have no family, sir?' I my head. 'I was aware that you sustained a bereavement, sir, some time ago,' said Mr. Chillip. 'I heard it from your father-in-law's sister. Very decided character there, sir?' 'Why, yes,' said I, 'decided enough. Where did you see her, Mr. Chillip?' 'Are you not aware, sir,' returned Mr. Chillip, with his placidest smile, 'that your father-in-law is again a neighbour of mine?' 'No,' said I. 'He is indeed, sir!' said Mr. Chillip. 'Married a young lady of that part, with a very good little property, poor thing. - And this action of the brain now, sir? Don't you find it fatigue you?' said Mr. Chillip, at me an admiring Robin. I waived that question, and returned to the Murdstones. 'I was aware of his being married again. Do you attend the family?' I 'Not regularly. I have been called in,' he replied. 'Strong phrenological developments of the organ of firmness, in Mr. Murdstone and his sister, sir.' I replied with such an expressive that Mr. Chillip was emboldened by that, and the negus together, to give his head several short and thoughtfully exclaim, 'Ah, dear me! We remember old times, Mr. Copperfield!' 'And the brother and sister are pursuing their old course, are they?' said I. 'Well, sir,' replied Mr. Chillip, 'a medical man, being so much in families, ought to have neither eyes nor ears for anything but his profession. Still, I must say, they are very severe, sir: both as to this life and the next.' 'The next will be regulated without much reference to them, I dare say,' I returned: 'what are they doing as to this?' Mr. Chillip his head, stirred his negus, and sipped it. 'She was a charming woman, sir!' he observed in a plaintive manner. 'The present Mrs. Murdstone?' A charming woman indeed, sir,' said Mr. Chillip; 'as amiable, I am sure, as it was possible to be! Mrs. Chillip's opinion is, that her spirit has been entirely since her marriage, and that she is all but melancholy mad. And the ladies,' observed Mr. Chillip, timorously, 'are great observers, sir.' 'I suppose she was to be subdued and to their detestable mould, Heaven help her!' said I. 'And she has been.' 'Well, sir, there were violent quarrels at first, I assure you,' said Mr. Chillip; 'but she is quite a shadow now. Would it be considered forward if I was to say to you, sir, in confidence, that since the sister came to help, the brother and sister between them have nearly reduced her to a state of imbecility?' I told him I could easily believe it. 'I have no hesitation in saying,' said Mr. Chillip, fortifying himself with another sip of negus, 'between you and me, sir, that her mother died of it - or that tyranny, gloom, and worry have made Mrs. Murdstone nearly imbecile. She was a lively young woman, sir, before marriage, and their gloom and austerity destroyed her. They go about with her, now, more her than her husband and sister-in-law. That was Mrs. Chillip's to me, only last And I assure you, sir, the ladies are great observers. Mrs. Chillip herself is a great observer!' 'Does he gloomily profess to be (I am ashamed to use the word in such association) religious still?' I inquired. 'You anticipate, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, his eyelids getting quite red with the unwonted stimulus in which he was indulging. 'One of Mrs. Chillip's most impressive Mrs. Chillip,' he proceeded, in the calmest and slowest manner, 'quite electrified me, by pointing out that Mr. Murdstone sets up an image of himself, and calls it the Divine Nature. You might have me down on the flat of my sir, with the feather of a pen, I assure you, when Mrs. Chillip said so. The ladies are great observers, sir?' 'Intuitively,' said I, to his extreme delight. 'I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion, sir,' he rejoined. 'It is not often that I venture to give a non-medical opinion, I assure you. Mr. Murdstone delivers public addresses sometimes, and it is said, - in short, sir, it is said by Mrs. Chillip, - that the tyrant he has lately been, the more ferocious is his doctrine.' 'I believe Mrs. Chillip to be perfectly right,' said I. 'Mrs. Chillip does go so far as to say,' pursued the of little men, much encouraged, 'that what such people miscall their religion, is a vent for their bad humours and arrogance. And do you I must say, sir,' he continued, mildly laying his head on one side, 'that I DON'T find authority for Mr. and Miss Murdstone in the New Testament?' 'I never found it either!' said I. 'In the meantime, sir,' said Mr. Chillip, 'they are much and as they are very free in consigning everybody who them to perdition, we really have a good deal of perdition going on in our neighbourhood! However, as Mrs. Chillip says, sir, they undergo a continual punishment; for they are turned inward, to feed upon their own hearts, and their own hearts are very bad feeding. Now, sir, about that brain of yours, if you'll excuse my returning to it. Don't you expose it to a good deal of excitement, sir?' I found it not difficult, in the excitement of Mr. Chillip's own brain, under his potations of negus, to divert his attention from this topic to his own affairs, on which, for the next half-hour, he was quite loquacious; giving me to understand, among other pieces of information, that he was then at the Gray's Inn Coffee-house to lay his professional evidence before a Commission of Lunacy, touching the state of mind of a patient who had become deranged from excessive 'And I assure you, sir,' he said, 'I am extremely nervous on such occasions. I could not support being what is called Bullied, sir. It would quite unman me. Do you it was some time before I recovered the conduct of that alarming lady, on the night of your birth, Mr. Copperfield?' I told him that I was going down to my aunt, the Dragon of that night, early in the morning; and that she was one of the most tender-hearted and excellent of women, as he would full well if he her better. The mere notion of the possibility of his ever seeing her again, appeared to terrify him. He replied with a small pale smile, 'Is she so, indeed, sir? Really?' and almost immediately called for a candle, and went to bed, as if he were not quite safe anywhere else. He did not actually stagger under the negus; but I should his placid little pulse must have made two or three more beats in a minute, than it had done since the great night of my aunt's disappointment, when she at him with her bonnet. Thoroughly tired, I went to bed too, at midnight; passed the next day on the Dover coach; burst safe and sound into my aunt's old parlour while she was at tea (she wore spectacles now); and was received by her, and Mr. and dear old Peggotty, who acted as with open arms and tears of joy. My aunt was mightily amused, when we began to composedly, by my account of my meeting with Mr. Chillip, and of his holding her in such dread remembrance; and both she and Peggotty had a great deal to say about my poor mother's second husband, and 'that murdering woman of a sister', - on whom I no pain or penalty would have induced my aunt to bestow any Christian or Proper Name, or any other designation. CHAPTER 60 AGNES My aunt and I, when we were left alone, far into the night. How the emigrants never wrote home, otherwise than cheerfully and hopefully; how Mr. Micawber had actually remitted divers small sums of money, on account of those 'pecuniary liabilities', in reference to which he had been so as between man and man; how Janet, returning into my aunt's service when she came to Dover, had finally carried out her renunciation of by entering into with a thriving and how my aunt had finally set her seal on the same great principle, by aiding and abetting the bride, and crowning the marriage-ceremony with her presence; were among our topics - already more or less familiar to me through the letters I had had. Mr. as usual, was not forgotten. My aunt informed me how he incessantly occupied himself in copying everything he could lay his hands on, and King Charles the First at a respectful distance by that semblance of employment; how it was one of the main joys and rewards of her life that he was free and happy, instead of pining in monotonous restraint; and how (as a novel general conclusion) nobody but she could ever fully what he was. 'And when, Trot,' said my aunt, patting the of my hand, as we sat in our old way before the fire, 'when are you going over to Canterbury?' 'I shall get a horse, and ride over tomorrow morning, aunt, unless you will go with me?' 'No!' said my aunt, in her short abrupt way. 'I mean to stay where I am.' Then, I should ride, I said. I could not have come through Canterbury today without stopping, if I had been coming to anyone but her. She was pleased, but answered, 'Tut, Trot; MY old bones would have till tomorrow!' and softly patted my hand again, as I sat thoughtfully at the fire. Thoughtfully, for I could not be here once more, and so near Agnes, without the revival of those regrets with which I had so long been occupied. Softened regrets they might be, teaching me what I had failed to learn when my younger life was all before me, but not the less regrets. 'Oh, Trot,' I seemed to hear my aunt say once more; and I understood her better now - 'Blind, blind, blind!' We both silence for some minutes. When I raised my eyes, I found that she was steadily observant of me. Perhaps she had followed the current of my mind; for it seemed to me an easy one to now, wilful as it had been once. 'You will find her father a white-haired old man,' said my aunt, 'though a better man in all other respects - a reclaimed man. Neither will you find him measuring all human interests, and joys, and sorrows, with his one poor little inch-rule now. Trust me, child, such things must very much, before they can be measured off in that way.' 'Indeed they must,' said I. 'You will find her,' pursued my aunt, 'as good, as beautiful, as earnest, as disinterested, as she has always been. If I higher praise, Trot, I would bestow it on her.' There was no higher praise for her; no higher reproach for me. Oh, how had I strayed so far away! 'If she trains the young girls whom she has about her, to be herself,' said my aunt, earnest even to the filling of her eyes with tears, 'Heaven her life will be well employed! Useful and happy, as she said that day! How could she be otherwise than useful and happy!' 'Has Agnes any -' I was aloud, rather than 'Well? Hey? Any what?' said my aunt, sharply. 'Any lover,' said I. 'A score,' cried my aunt, with a of indignant pride. 'She might have married twenty times, my dear, since you have been gone!' 'No doubt,' said I. 'No doubt. But has she any lover who is worthy of her? Agnes could care for no other.' My aunt sat musing for a little while, with her chin upon her hand. Slowly raising her eyes to mine, she said: 'I suspect she has an attachment, Trot.' 'A prosperous one?' said I. 'Trot,' returned my aunt gravely, 'I can't say. I have no right to tell you even so much. She has never confided it to me, but I suspect it.' She so attentively and anxiously at me (I even saw her tremble), that I felt now, more than ever, that she had followed my late thoughts. I summoned all the resolutions I had made, in all those many days and nights, and all those many conflicts of my heart. 'If it should be so,' I began, 'and I hope it is-' 'I don't that it is,' said my aunt curtly. 'You must not be ruled by my suspicions. You must them secret. They are very slight, perhaps. I have no right to 'If it should be so,' I repeated, 'Agnes will tell me at her own good time. A sister to whom I have confided so much, aunt, will not be reluctant to confide in me.' My aunt withdrew her eyes from mine, as slowly as she had turned them upon me; and covered them thoughtfully with her hand. By and by she put her other hand on my shoulder; and so we both sat, into the past, without saying another word, until we parted for the night. I rode away, early in the morning, for the scene of my old school-days. I cannot say that I was yet quite happy, in the hope that I was gaining a victory over myself; even in the prospect of so soon on her face again. The well-remembered ground was soon traversed, and I came into the quiet streets, where every stone was a boy's to me. I went on foot to the old house, and went away with a heart too full to enter. I returned; and as I passed, through the low window of the turret-room where first Uriah Heep, and afterwards Mr. Micawber, had been wont to sit, saw that it was a little parlour now, and that there was no office. Otherwise the staid old house was, as to its cleanliness and order, still just as it had been when I first saw it. I requested the new maid who admitted me, to tell Miss that a gentleman who waited on her from a friend abroad, was there; and I was shown up the grave old staircase (cautioned of the steps I so well), into the unchanged drawing-room. The that Agnes and I had read together, were on their shelves; and the where I had laboured at my lessons, many a night, stood yet at the same old corner of the table. All the little changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there, were changed again. Everything was as it used to be, in the happy time. I stood in a window, and across the ancient street at the opposite houses, recalling how I had watched them on wet afternoons, when I first came there; and how I had used to speculate about the people who appeared at any of the windows, and had followed them with my eyes up and down stairs, while women went along the pavement in pattens, and the dull rain fell in slanting lines, and poured out of the water-spout yonder, and flowed into the road. The feeling with which I used to watch the tramps, as they came into the town on those wet evenings, at and limped past, with their bundles drooping over their shoulders at the ends of came freshly to me; fraught, as then, with the smell of damp earth, and wet leaves and briar, and the sensation of the very airs that blew upon me in my own toilsome journey. The opening of the little door in the panelled wall made me start and turn. Her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me. She stopped and laid her hand upon her bosom, and I caught her in my arms. 'Agnes! my dear girl! I have come too suddenly upon you.' 'No, no! I am so rejoiced to see you, Trotwood!' 'Dear Agnes, the happiness it is to me, to see you once again!' I folded her to my heart, and, for a little while, we were both silent. Presently we sat down, side by side; and her angel-face was turned upon me with the welcome I had dreamed of, and sleeping, for whole years. She was so true, she was so beautiful, she was so good, - I owed her so much gratitude, she was so dear to me, that I could find no utterance for what I felt. I tried to bless her, tried to her, tried to tell her (as I had often done in letters) what an influence she had upon me; but all my efforts were in vain. My love and joy were dumb. With her own sweet tranquillity, she calmed my agitation; led me to the time of our parting; to me of Emily, whom she had visited, in secret, many times; to me tenderly of Dora's grave. With the unerring instinct of her noble heart, she touched the chords of my memory so softly and harmoniously, that not one jarred within me; I could listen to the sorrowful, distant music, and desire to from nothing it How could I, when, blended with it all, was her dear self, the better angel of my life? 'And you, Agnes,' I said, by and by. 'Tell me of yourself. You have hardly ever told me of your own life, in all this lapse of time!' 'What should I tell?' she answered, with her radiant smile. 'Papa is well. You see us here, quiet in our own home; our anxieties set at rest, our home restored to us; and that, dear Trotwood, you all.' 'All, Agnes?' said I. She at me, with some fluttering wonder in her face. 'Is there nothing else, Sister?' I said. Her colour, which had just now faded, returned, and faded again. She smiled; with a quiet sadness, I thought; and her head. I had sought to lead her to what my aunt had hinted at; for, sharply painful to me as it must be to receive that confidence, I was to discipline my heart, and do my duty to her. I saw, however, that she was uneasy, and I let it pass. 'You have much to do, dear Agnes?' 'With my school?' said she, up again, in all her bright composure. 'Yes. It is laborious, is it not?' 'The labour is so pleasant,' she returned, 'that it is scarcely grateful in me to call it by that name.' 'Nothing good is difficult to you,' said I. Her colour came and went once more; and once more, as she bent her head, I saw the same sad smile. 'You will wait and see papa,' said Agnes, cheerfully, 'and pass the day with us? Perhaps you will sleep in your own room? We always call it yours.' I could not do that, having promised to ride to my aunt's at night; but I would pass the day there, joyfully. 'I must be a prisoner for a little while,' said Agnes, 'but here are the old Trotwood, and the old music.' 'Even the old flowers are here,' said I, round; 'or the old 'I have found a pleasure,' returned Agnes, smiling, 'while you have been absent, in everything as it used to be when we were children. For we were very happy then, I 'Heaven we were!' said I. 'And every little thing that has reminded me of my brother,' said Agnes, with her cordial eyes turned cheerfully upon me, 'has been a welcome companion. Even this,' showing me the full of still hanging at her side, 'seems to jingle a of old tune!' She smiled again, and went out at the door by which she had come. It was for me to guard this sisterly affection with religious care. It was all that I had left myself, and it was a treasure. If I once the foundations of the sacred confidence and usage, in virtue of which it was given to me, it was lost, and could never be recovered. I set this steadily before myself. The better I loved her, the more it behoved me never to forget it. I through the streets; and, once more seeing my old adversary the butcher - now a constable, with his staff hanging up in the shop - went down to at the place where I had fought him; and there meditated on Miss Shepherd and the eldest Miss and all the idle loves and and of that time. Nothing seemed to have survived that time but Agnes; and she, ever a star above me, was brighter and higher. When I returned, Mr. had come home, from a garden he had, a couple of miles or so out of town, where he now employed himself almost every day. I found him as my aunt had described him. We sat down to dinner, with some half-dozen little girls; and he seemed but the shadow of his handsome picture on the wall. The tranquillity and peace belonging, of old, to that quiet ground in my memory, pervaded it again. When dinner was done, Mr. no wine, and I desiring none, we went up-stairs; where Agnes and her little charges sang and played, and After tea the children left us; and we three sat together, of the bygone days. 'My part in them,' said Mr. his white head, 'has much matter for regret - for deep regret, and deep contrition, Trotwood, you well But I would not cancel it, if it were in my power.' I could readily believe that, at the face beside him. 'I should cancel with it,' he pursued, 'such patience and devotion, such fidelity, such a child's love, as I must not forget, no! even to forget myself.' 'I understand you, sir,' I softly said. 'I hold it - I have always held it - in veneration.' 'But no one not even you,' he returned, 'how much she has done, how much she has undergone, how hard she has striven. Dear Agnes!' She had put her hand entreatingly on his arm, to stop him; and was very, very pale. 'Well, well!' he said with a sigh, dismissing, as I then saw, some trial she had borne, or was yet to bear, in connexion with what my aunt had told me. 'Well! I have never told you, Trotwood, of her mother. Has anyone?' 'Never, sir.' 'It's not much - though it was much to suffer. She married me in opposition to her father's wish, and he renounced her. She prayed him to forgive her, before my Agnes came into this world. He was a very hard man, and her mother had long been dead. He repulsed her. He her heart.' Agnes leaned upon his shoulder, and stole her arm about his 'She had an affectionate and gentle heart,' he said; 'and it was I its tender nature very well. No one could, if I did not. She loved me dearly, but was never happy. She was always labouring, in secret, under this distress; and being delicate and downcast at the time of his last repulse - for it was not the first, by many - pined away and died. She left me Agnes, two old; and the grey hair that you recollect me with, when you first came.' He Agnes on her 'My love for my dear child was a diseased love, but my mind was all unhealthy then. I say no more of that. I am not of myself, Trotwood, but of her mother, and of her. If I give you any clue to what I am, or to what I have been, you will unravel it, I What Agnes is, I need not say. I have always read something of her poor mother's story, in her character; and so I tell it you tonight, when we three are again together, after such great changes. I have told it all.' His bowed head, and her angel-face and filial duty, derived a more pathetic meaning from it than they had had before. If I had wanted anything by which to this night of our re-union, I should have found it in this. Agnes rose up from her father's side, before long; and going softly to her piano, played some of the old airs to which we had often listened in that place. 'Have you any intention of going away again?' Agnes me, as I was standing by. 'What does my sister say to that?' 'I hope not.' 'Then I have no such intention, Agnes.' 'I you ought not, Trotwood, since you me,' she said, mildly. 'Your growing reputation and success enlarge your power of doing good; and if I could spare my brother,' with her eyes upon me, 'perhaps the time could not.' 'What I am, you have made me, Agnes. You should best.' 'I made you, Trotwood?' 'Yes! Agnes, my dear girl!' I said, bending over her. 'I tried to tell you, when we met today, something that has been in my thoughts since Dora died. You remember, when you came down to me in our little room - pointing upward, Agnes?' 'Oh, Trotwood!' she returned, her eyes filled with tears. 'So loving, so confiding, and so young! Can I ever forget?' 'As you were then, my sister, I have often thought since, you have ever been to me. Ever pointing upward, Agnes; ever leading me to something better; ever directing me to higher things!' She only her head; through her tears I saw the same sad quiet smile. 'And I am so grateful to you for it, Agnes, so bound to you, that there is no name for the affection of my heart. I want you to yet don't how to tell you, that all my life long I shall up to you, and be guided by you, as I have been through the that is past. Whatever betides, whatever new ties you may form, whatever changes may come between us, I shall always to you, and love you, as I do now, and have always done. You will always be my solace and resource, as you have always been. Until I die, my dearest sister, I shall see you always before me, pointing upward!' She put her hand in mine, and told me she was proud of me, and of what I said; although I praised her very far beyond her worth. Then she went on softly playing, but without removing her eyes from me. 'Do you what I have heard tonight, Agnes,' said I, strangely seems to be a part of the feeling with which I regarded you when I saw you first - with which I sat beside you in my rough school-days?' 'You I had no mother,' she replied with a smile, 'and felt towards me.' 'More than that, Agnes, I almost as if I had this story, that there was something inexplicably gentle and softened, surrounding you; something that might have been sorrowful in someone else (as I can now understand it was), but was not so in you.' She softly played on, at me still. 'Will you laugh at my cherishing such fancies, Agnes?' 'No!' 'Or at my saying that I really believe I felt, even then, that you could be faithfully affectionate against all discouragement, and never cease to be so, until you ceased to live? - Will you laugh at such a dream?' 'Oh, no! Oh, no!' For an instant, a distressful shadow crossed her face; but, even in the start it gave me, it was gone; and she was playing on, and at me with her own calm smile. As I rode in the lonely night, the wind going by me a restless memory, I thought of this, and feared she was not happy. I was not happy; but, thus far, I had faithfully set the seal upon the Past, and, of her, pointing upward, thought of her as pointing to that above me, where, in the mystery to come, I might yet love her with a love on earth, and tell her what the strife had been within me when I loved her here. CHAPTER 61 I AM SHOWN TWO INTERESTING PENITENTS For a time - at all events until my should be completed, which would be the of several months - I up my abode in my aunt's house at Dover; and there, sitting in the window from which I had out at the moon upon the sea, when that roof first gave me shelter, I quietly pursued my In pursuance of my intention of referring to my own fictions only when their course should incidentally connect itself with the progress of my story, I do not enter on the aspirations, the delights, anxieties, and triumphs of my art. That I truly devoted myself to it with my strongest earnestness, and bestowed upon it every energy of my soul, I have already said. If the I have written be of any worth, they will supply the rest. I shall otherwise have written to poor purpose, and the rest will be of interest to no one. Occasionally, I went to London; to lose myself in the swarm of life there, or to consult with Traddles on some business point. He had managed for me, in my absence, with the soundest judgement; and my worldly affairs were prospering. As my notoriety began to bring upon me an enormous quantity of letters from people of whom I had no - chiefly about nothing, and extremely difficult to answer - I agreed with Traddles to have my name painted up on his door. There, the devoted postman on that beat delivered bushels of letters for me; and there, at intervals, I laboured through them, a Home Secretary of State without the salary. Among this correspondence, there dropped in, every now and then, an obliging proposal from one of the numerous outsiders always about the Commons, to practise under cover of my name (if I would the necessary steps remaining to a proctor of myself), and pay me a percentage on the profits. But I declined these offers; being already aware that there were plenty of such covert practitioners in existence, and considering the Commons quite bad enough, without my doing anything to it worse. The girls had gone home, when my name burst into bloom on Traddles's door; and the sharp boy all day, as if he had never heard of Sophy, shut up in a room, glancing down from her into a sooty little strip of garden with a pump in it. But there I always found her, the same bright housewife; often humming her Devonshire ballads when no strange foot was coming up the stairs, and blunting the sharp boy in his official closet with melody. I wondered, at first, why I so often found Sophy writing in a and why she always shut it up when I appeared, and hurried it into the table-drawer. But the secret soon came out. One day, Traddles (who had just come home through the drizzling sleet from Court) a paper out of his and me what I thought of that handwriting? 'Oh, DON'T, Tom!' cried Sophy, who was warming his slippers before the fire. 'My dear,' returned Tom, in a delighted state, 'why not? What do you say to that writing, Copperfield?' 'It's extraordinarily legal and formal,' said I. 'I don't I ever saw such a stiff hand.' 'Not a lady's hand, is it?' said Traddles. 'A lady's!' I repeated. and mortar are more a lady's hand!' Traddles into a rapturous laugh, and informed me that it was Sophy's writing; that Sophy had vowed and declared he would need a soon, and she would be that that she had acquired this hand from a pattern; and that she could throw off - I forget how many folios an hour. Sophy was very much confused by my being told all this, and said that when 'Tom' was made a judge he wouldn't be so ready to proclaim it. Which 'Tom' denied; averring that he should always be equally proud of it, under all circumstances. 'What a thoroughly good and charming wife she is, my dear Traddles!' said I, when she had gone away, laughing. 'My dear Copperfield,' returned Traddles, 'she is, without any exception, the dearest girl! The way she manages this place; her punctuality, domestic economy, and order; her cheerfulness, Copperfield!' 'Indeed, you have reason to commend her!' I returned. 'You are a happy fellow. I believe you yourselves, and each other, two of the happiest people in the world.' 'I am sure we ARE two of the happiest people,' returned Traddles. 'I admit that, at all events. Bless my soul, when I see her getting up by candle-light on these mornings, busying herself in the day's arrangements, going out to before the come into the Inn, caring for no weather, devising the most capital little dinners out of the plainest materials, puddings and pies, everything in its right place, always so neat and ornamental herself, sitting up at night with me if it's ever so late, sweet-tempered and encouraging always, and all for me, I positively sometimes can't believe it, Copperfield!' He was tender of the very slippers she had been warming, as he put them on, and stretched his feet enjoyingly upon the fender. 'I positively sometimes can't believe it,' said Traddles. 'Then our pleasures! Dear me, they are inexpensive, but they are quite wonderful! When we are at home here, of an evening, and shut the outer door, and draw those curtains - which she made - where could we be more snug? When it's fine, and we go out for a in the evening, the streets abound in enjoyment for us. We into the glittering windows of the jewellers' shops; and I show Sophy which of the diamond-eyed serpents, coiled up on white satin rising grounds, I would give her if I could afford it; and Sophy shows me which of the gold watches that are capped and jewelled and engine-turned, and possessed of the horizontal lever- escape-movement, and all sorts of things, she would buy for me if she could afford it; and we out the spoons and fish-slices, and sugar-tongs, we should both prefer if we could both afford it; and really we go away as if we had got them! Then, when we stroll into the squares, and great streets, and see a house to let, sometimes we up at it, and say, how would THAT do, if I was made a judge? And we parcel it out - such a room for us, such rooms for the girls, and so forth; until we settle to our satisfaction that it would do, or it wouldn't do, as the case may be. Sometimes, we go at half-price to the pit of the theatre - the very smell of which is cheap, in my opinion, at the money - and there we thoroughly enjoy the play: which Sophy believes every word of, and so do I. In home, perhaps we buy a little bit of something at a or a little lobster at the fishmongers, and bring it here, and a splendid supper, chatting about what we have seen. Now, you Copperfield, if I was Lord Chancellor, we couldn't do this!' 'You would do something, whatever you were, my dear Traddles,' thought I, 'that would be pleasant and amiable. And by the way,' I said aloud, 'I suppose you never draw any now?' 'Really,' replied Traddles, laughing, and reddening, 'I can't wholly deny that I do, my dear Copperfield. For being in one of the rows of the King's Bench the other day, with a pen in my hand, the fancy came into my head to try how I had preserved that accomplishment. And I am afraid there's a - in a wig - on the ledge of the After we had both laughed heartily, Traddles wound up by with a smile at the fire, and saying, in his forgiving way, 'Old 'I have a letter from that old - Rascal here,' said I. For I never was less disposed to forgive him the way he used to batter Traddles, than when I saw Traddles so ready to forgive him himself. 'From the schoolmaster?' exclaimed Traddles. 'No!' 'Among the persons who are attracted to me in my rising fame and fortune,' said I, over my letters, 'and who discover that they were always much attached to me, is the self-same He is not a schoolmaster now, Traddles. He is retired. He is a Middlesex Magistrate.' I thought Traddles might be surprised to hear it, but he was not so at all. 'How do you suppose he comes to be a Middlesex Magistrate?' said I. 'Oh dear me!' replied Traddles, 'it would be very difficult to answer that question. Perhaps he voted for somebody, or lent money to somebody, or bought something of somebody, or otherwise obliged somebody, or jobbed for somebody, who somebody who got the lieutenant of the county to nominate him for the commission.' 'On the commission he is, at any rate,' said I. 'And he writes to me here, that he will be glad to show me, in operation, the only true system of prison discipline; the only unchallengeable way of sincere and lasting converts and penitents - which, you is by solitary confinement. What do you say?' 'To the system?' inquired Traddles, grave. 'No. To my accepting the offer, and your going with me?' 'I don't object,' said Traddles. 'Then I'll write to say so. You remember (to say nothing of our treatment) this same turning his son out of doors, I suppose, and the life he used to lead his wife and daughter?' 'Perfectly,' said Traddles. 'Yet, if you'll read his letter, you'll find he is the tenderest of men to prisoners convicted of the whole calendar of felonies,' said I; 'though I can't find that his tenderness extends to any other class of created beings.' Traddles shrugged his shoulders, and was not at all surprised. I had not expected him to be, and was not surprised myself; or my observation of similar practical satires would have been but scanty. We arranged the time of our visit, and I wrote accordingly to Mr. that evening. On the appointed day - I it was the next day, but no matter - Traddles and I repaired to the prison where Mr. was powerful. It was an immense and solid building, erected at a vast expense. I could not help as we approached the gate, what an uproar would have been made in the country, if any deluded man had proposed to spend one half the money it had cost, on the erection of an industrial school for the young, or a house of refuge for the deserving old. In an office that might have been on the ground-floor of the Tower of Babel, it was so massively constructed, we were presented to our old schoolmaster; who was one of a group, composed of two or three of the busier sort of magistrates, and some visitors they had brought. He received me, a man who had formed my mind in bygone years, and had always loved me tenderly. On my introducing Traddles, Mr. expressed, in manner, but in an inferior degree, that he had always been Traddles's guide, philosopher, and friend. Our venerable instructor was a great deal older, and not improved in appearance. His face was as fiery as ever; his eyes were as small, and rather deeper set. The scanty, grey hair, by which I remembered him, was almost gone; and the veins in his bald head were none the more agreeable to at. After some conversation among these gentlemen, from which I might have supposed that there was nothing in the world to be legitimately into account but the supreme comfort of prisoners, at any expense, and nothing on the wide earth to be done outside prison-doors, we began our inspection. It being then just dinner-time, we went, first into the great where every prisoner's dinner was in course of being set out separately (to be handed to him in his cell), with the regularity and precision of I said aside, to Traddles, that I wondered whether it occurred to anybody, that there was a contrast between these plentiful repasts of choice quality, and the dinners, not to say of paupers, but of soldiers, sailors, labourers, the great of the honest, community; of whom not one man in five hundred ever dined half so well. But I learned that the 'system' required high living; and, in short, to dispose of the system, once for all, I found that on that head and on all others, 'the system' put an end to all doubts, and disposed of all anomalies. Nobody appeared to have the least idea that there was any other system, but THE system, to be considered. As we were going through some of the magnificent passages, I inquired of Mr. and his friends what were supposed to be the main advantages of this all-governing and universally over-riding system? I found them to be the perfect isolation of prisoners - so that no one man in confinement there, anything about another; and the reduction of prisoners to a wholesome state of mind, leading to sincere contrition and repentance. Now, it me, when we began to visit individuals in their cells, and to traverse the passages in which those cells were, and to have the manner of the going to chapel and so forth, explained to us, that there was a strong probability of the prisoners a good deal about each other, and of their carrying on a pretty complete system of intercourse. This, at the time I write, has been proved, I believe, to be the case; but, as it would have been flat blasphemy against the system to have hinted such a doubt then, I out for the penitence as diligently as I could. And here again, I had great misgivings. I found as prevalent a fashion in the form of the penitence, as I had left outside in the forms of the coats and waistcoats in the windows of the tailors' shops. I found a vast amount of profession, varying very little in character: varying very little (which I thought exceedingly suspicious), even in words. I found a great many foxes, disparaging whole vineyards of inaccessible grapes; but I found very few foxes whom I would have trusted within reach of a bunch. Above all, I found that the most professing men were the greatest objects of interest; and that their conceit, their vanity, their want of excitement, and their love of deception (which many of them possessed to an almost incredible extent, as their histories showed), all prompted to these professions, and were all gratified by them. However, I heard so repeatedly, in the course of our goings to and fro, of a certain Number Twenty Seven, who was the Favourite, and who really appeared to be a Model Prisoner, that I resolved to suspend my judgement until I should see Twenty Seven. Twenty Eight, I understood, was also a bright particular star; but it was his misfortune to have his glory a little dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of Twenty Seven. I heard so much of Twenty Seven, of his pious admonitions to everybody around him, and of the beautiful letters he constantly wrote to his mother (whom he seemed to consider in a very bad way), that I became quite impatient to see him. I had to restrain my impatience for some time, on account of Twenty Seven being reserved for a concluding effect. But, at last, we came to the door of his cell; and Mr. through a little hole in it, reported to us, in a state of the greatest admiration, that he was reading a Hymn There was such a rush of heads immediately, to see Number Twenty Seven reading his Hymn that the little hole was up, six or seven heads deep. To remedy this inconvenience, and give us an opportunity of conversing with Twenty Seven in all his purity, Mr. directed the door of the cell to be and Twenty Seven to be invited out into the passage. This was done; and whom should Traddles and I then behold, to our amazement, in this converted Number Twenty Seven, but Uriah Heep! He us directly; and said, as he came out - with the old writhe, - 'How do you do, Mr. Copperfield? How do you do, Mr. Traddles?' This recognition caused a general admiration in the party. I rather thought that everyone was by his not being proud, and notice of us. 'Well, Twenty Seven,' said Mr. mournfully admiring him. 'How do you find yourself today?' 'I am very umble, sir!' replied Uriah Heep. 'You are always so, Twenty Seven,' said Mr. Here, another gentleman with extreme anxiety: 'Are you quite comfortable?' 'Yes, I you, sir!' said Uriah Heep, in that direction. 'Far more comfortable here, than ever I was outside. I see my follies, now, sir. That's what me comfortable.' Several gentlemen were much affected; and a third questioner, forcing himself to the front, inquired with extreme feeling: 'How do you find the beef?' you, sir,' replied Uriah, glancing in the new direction of this voice, 'it was tougher yesterday than I could wish; but it's my duty to bear. I have committed follies, gentlemen,' said Uriah, round with a smile, 'and I ought to bear the consequences without repining.' A murmur, partly of gratification at Twenty Seven's celestial state of mind, and partly of indignation against the Contractor who had given him any cause of complaint (a note of which was immediately made by Mr. having subsided, Twenty Seven stood in the midst of us, as if he felt himself the principal object of merit in a highly meritorious museum. That we, the neophytes, might have an excess of light shining upon us all at once, orders were given to let out Twenty Eight. I had been so much astonished already, that I only felt a of resigned wonder when Mr. Littimer forth, reading a good 'Twenty Eight,' said a gentleman in spectacles, who had not yet 'you complained last my good fellow, of the cocoa. How has it been since?' 'I you, sir,' said Mr. Littimer, 'it has been better made. If I might the liberty of saying so, sir, I don't the which is boiled with it is quite genuine; but I am aware, sir, that there is a great adulteration of in London, and that the article in a pure state is difficult to be obtained.' It appeared to me that the gentleman in spectacles his Twenty Eight against Mr. Twenty Seven, for each of them his own man in hand. 'What is your state of mind, Twenty Eight?' said the questioner in spectacles. 'I you, sir,' returned Mr. Littimer; 'I see my follies now, sir. I am a good deal troubled when I of the sins of my former companions, sir; but I trust they may find forgiveness.' 'You are quite happy yourself?' said the questioner, nodding encouragement. 'I am much obliged to you, sir,' returned Mr. Littimer. 'Perfectly so.' 'Is there anything at all on your mind now?' said the questioner. 'If so, mention it, Twenty Eight.' 'Sir,' said Mr. Littimer, without up, 'if my eyes have not deceived me, there is a gentleman present who was acquainted with me in my former life. It may be profitable to that gentleman to sir, that I attribute my past follies, entirely to having lived a thoughtless life in the service of young men; and to having allowed myself to be led by them into which I had not the strength to resist. I hope that gentleman will warning, sir, and will not be offended at my freedom. It is for his good. I am conscious of my own past follies. I hope he may repent of all the and sin to which he has been a party.' I observed that several gentlemen were shading their eyes, each with one hand, as if they had just come into church. 'This does you credit, Twenty Eight,' returned the questioner. 'I should have expected it of you. Is there anything else?' 'Sir,' returned Mr. Littimer, slightly lifting up his eyebrows, but not his eyes, 'there was a young woman who fell into dissolute courses, that I endeavoured to save, sir, but could not rescue. I beg that gentleman, if he has it in his power, to inform that young woman from me that I forgive her her bad conduct towards myself, and that I call her to repentance - if he will be so good.' 'I have no doubt, Twenty Eight,' returned the questioner, 'that the gentleman you refer to feels very strongly - as we all must - what you have so properly said. We will not detain you.' 'I you, sir,' said Mr. Littimer. 'Gentlemen, I wish you a good day, and hoping you and your families will also see your and amend!' With this, Number Twenty Eight retired, after a glance between him and Uriah; as if they were not altogether to each other, through some medium of communication; and a murmur went round the group, as his door shut upon him, that he was a most respectable man, and a beautiful case. 'Now, Twenty Seven,' said Mr. entering on a clear stage with his man, 'is there anything that anyone can do for you? If so, mention it.' 'I would umbly sir,' returned Uriah, with a of his malevolent head, 'for leave to write again to mother.' 'It shall certainly be granted,' said Mr. you, sir! I am anxious about mother. I am afraid she ain't safe.' Somebody incautiously what from? But there was a scandalized whisper of 'Hush!' 'Immortally safe, sir,' returned Uriah, writhing in the direction of the voice. 'I should wish mother to be got into my state. I never should have been got into my present state if I hadn't come here. I wish mother had come here. It would be better for everybody, if they got up, and was brought here.' This sentiment gave unbounded satisfaction - greater satisfaction, I than anything that had passed yet. 'Before I come here,' said Uriah, stealing a at us, as if he would have blighted the outer world to which we belonged, if he could, 'I was given to follies; but now I am sensible of my follies. There's a deal of sin outside. There's a deal of sin in mother. There's nothing but sin everywhere - except here.' 'You are quite changed?' said Mr. 'Oh dear, yes, sir!' cried this hopeful penitent. 'You wouldn't relapse, if you were going out?' somebody else. 'Oh de-ar no, sir!' 'Well!' said Mr. 'this is very gratifying. You have addressed Mr. Copperfield, Twenty Seven. Do you wish to say anything further to him?' 'You me, a long time before I came here and was changed, Mr. Copperfield,' said Uriah, at me; and a more villainous I never saw, even on his visage. 'You me when, in spite of my follies, I was umble among them that was proud, and among them that was violent - you was violent to me yourself, Mr. Copperfield. Once, you me a blow in the face, you General commiseration. Several indignant glances directed at me. 'But I forgive you, Mr. Copperfield,' said Uriah, his forgiving nature the subject of a most impious and awful parallel, which I shall not record. 'I forgive everybody. It would ill become me to bear malice. I freely forgive you, and I hope you'll curb your passions in future. I hope Mr. W. will repent, and Miss W., and all of that sinful lot. You've been visited with affliction, and I hope it may do you good; but you'd better have come here. Mr. W. had better have come here, and Miss W. too. The best wish I could give you, Mr. Copperfield, and give all of you gentlemen, is, that you could be up and brought here. When I of my past follies, and my present state, I am sure it would be best for you. I pity all who ain't brought here!' He into his cell, amidst a little chorus of approbation; and both Traddles and I experienced a great relief when he was in. It was a characteristic feature in this repentance, that I was fain to what these two men had done, to be there at all. That appeared to be the last thing about which they had anything to say. I addressed myself to one of the two warders, who, I suspected from certain latent indications in their faces, pretty well what all this stir was worth. 'Do you said I, as we along the passage, 'what felony was Number Twenty Seven's last \"folly\"?' The answer was that it was a case. 'A fraud on the of England?' I 'Yes, sir. Fraud, forgery, and conspiracy. He and some others. He set the others on. It was a deep plot for a large sum. Sentence, transportation for life. Twenty Seven was the bird of the lot, and had very nearly himself safe; but not quite. The was just able to put salt upon his tail - and only just.' 'Do you Twenty Eight's offence?' 'Twenty Eight,' returned my informant, throughout in a low tone, and over his shoulder as we along the passage, to guard himself from being overheard, in such an unlawful reference to these Immaculates, by and the rest; 'Twenty Eight (also transportation) got a place, and robbed a young master of a matter of two hundred and fifty pounds in money and valuables, the night before they were going abroad. I particularly recollect his case, from his being by a dwarf.' 'A what?' 'A little woman. I have forgot her name?' 'Not Mowcher?' 'That's it! He had eluded pursuit, and was going to America in a flaxen wig, and and such a complete disguise as never you see in all your born days; when the little woman, being in Southampton, met him along the street - him out with her sharp eye in a moment - ran betwixt his legs to upset him - and held on to him grim Death.' 'Excellent Miss Mowcher!' cried I. 'You'd have said so, if you had seen her, standing on a chair in the witness-box at the trial, as I did,' said my friend. 'He cut her face right open, and pounded her in the most brutal manner, when she him; but she never loosed her hold till he was up. She held so tight to him, in fact, that the officers were obliged to 'em both together. She gave her evidence in the gamest way, and was highly complimented by the Bench, and cheered right home to her lodgings. She said in Court that she'd have him single-handed (on account of what she concerning him), if he had been Samson. And it's my belief she would!' It was mine too, and I highly respected Miss Mowcher for it. We had now seen all there was to see. It would have been in vain to represent to such a man as the Worshipful Mr. that Twenty Seven and Twenty Eight were perfectly consistent and unchanged; that exactly what they were then, they had always been; that the hypocritical were just the subjects to that sort of profession in such a place; that they its at least as well as we did, in the immediate service it would do them when they were expatriated; in a word, that it was a rotten, hollow, painfully suggestive piece of business altogether. We left them to their system and themselves, and went home wondering. 'Perhaps it's a good thing, Traddles,' said I, 'to have an unsound Hobby ridden hard; for it's the sooner ridden to death.' 'I hope so,' replied Traddles. CHAPTER 62 A LIGHT SHINES ON MY WAY The year came round to Christmas-time, and I had been at home above two months. I had seen Agnes frequently. However loud the general voice might be in giving me encouragement, and however fervent the emotions and endeavours to which it roused me, I heard her lightest word of praise as I heard nothing else. At least once a and sometimes oftener, I rode over there, and passed the evening. I usually rode at night; for the old unhappy sense was always hovering about me now - most sorrowfully when I left her - and I was glad to be up and out, rather than wandering over the past in weary or miserable dreams. I wore away the longest part of many wild sad nights, in those rides; reviving, as I went, the thoughts that had occupied me in my long absence. Or, if I were to say rather that I listened to the echoes of those thoughts, I should better express the truth. They to me from afar off. I had put them at a distance, and accepted my inevitable place. When I read to Agnes what I wrote; when I saw her listening face; moved her to smiles or tears; and heard her cordial voice so earnest on the shadowy events of that imaginative world in which I lived; I thought what a fate mine might have been - but only thought so, as I had thought after I was married to Dora, what I could have wished my wife to be. My duty to Agnes, who loved me with a love, which, if I disquieted, I wronged most selfishly and poorly, and could never restore; my matured assurance that I, who had out my own destiny, and won what I had impetuously set my heart on, had no right to murmur, and must bear; comprised what I felt and what I had learned. But I loved her: and now it even became some consolation to me, vaguely to conceive a distant day when I might blamelessly avow it; when all this should be over; when I could say 'Agnes, so it was when I came home; and now I am old, and I never have loved since!' She did not once show me any change in herself. What she always had been to me, she still was; wholly unaltered. Between my aunt and me there had been something, in this connexion, since the night of my return, which I cannot call a restraint, or an avoidance of the subject, so much as an implied understanding that we thought of it together, but did not shape our thoughts into words. When, according to our old custom, we sat before the fire at night, we often fell into this train; as naturally, and as consciously to each other, as if we had unreservedly said so. But we preserved an silence. I believed that she had read, or partly read, my thoughts that night; and that she fully comprehended why I gave mine no more distinct expression. This Christmas-time being come, and Agnes having reposed no new confidence in me, a doubt that had several times arisen in my mind - whether she could have that perception of the true state of my breast, which restrained her with the apprehension of giving me pain - began to oppress me heavily. If that were so, my sacrifice was nothing; my plainest obligation to her unfulfilled; and every poor action I had from, I was hourly doing. I resolved to set this right beyond all doubt; - if such a barrier were between us, to it down at once with a determined hand. It was - what lasting reason have I to remember it! - a cold, harsh, winter day. There had been snow, some hours before; and it lay, not deep, but hard-frozen on the ground. Out at sea, beyond my window, the wind blew ruggedly from the north. I had been of it, sweeping over those mountain wastes of snow in Switzerland, then inaccessible to any human foot; and had been speculating which was the lonelier, those solitary regions, or a deserted ocean. 'Riding today, Trot?' said my aunt, putting her head in at the door. 'Yes,' said I, 'I am going over to Canterbury. It's a good day for a ride.' 'I hope your horse may so too,' said my aunt; 'but at present he is holding down his head and his ears, standing before the door there, as if he thought his stable preferable.' My aunt, I may observe, allowed my horse on the forbidden ground, but had not at all relented towards the 'He will be fresh enough, presently!' said I. 'The ride will do his master good, at all events,' observed my aunt, glancing at the papers on my table. 'Ah, child, you pass a good many hours here! I never thought, when I used to read what it was to write them.' 'It's enough to read them, sometimes,' I returned. 'As to the writing, it has its own charms, aunt.' 'Ah! I see!' said my aunt. 'Ambition, love of approbation, sympathy, and much more, I suppose? Well: go along with you!' 'Do you anything more,' said I, standing composedly before her - she had patted me on the shoulder, and sat down in my chair - 'of that attachment of Agnes?' She up in my face a little while, before replying: 'I I do, Trot.' 'Are you confirmed in your impression?' I inquired. 'I I am, Trot.' She so steadfastly at me: with a of doubt, or pity, or suspense in her affection: that I summoned the stronger determination to show her a perfectly cheerful face. 'And what is more, Trot -' said my aunt. 'Yes!' 'I Agnes is going to be married.' 'God bless her!' said I, cheerfully. 'God bless her!' said my aunt, 'and her husband too!' I echoed it, parted from my aunt, and went lightly downstairs, mounted, and rode away. There was greater reason than before to do what I had resolved to do. How well I recollect the wintry ride! The frozen particles of ice, brushed from the blades of grass by the wind, and borne across my face; the hard clatter of the horse's hoofs, beating a tune upon the ground; the stiff-tilled soil; the snowdrift, lightly eddying in the as the breeze ruffled it; the team with the waggon of old hay, stopping to breathe on the hill-top, and their bells musically; the whitened slopes and sweeps of Down-land lying against the as if they were drawn on a huge slate! I found Agnes alone. The little girls had gone to their own homes now, and she was alone by the fire, reading. She put down her on seeing me come in; and having welcomed me as usual, her and sat in one of the old-fashioned windows. I sat beside her on the window-seat, and we of what I was doing, and when it would be done, and of the progress I had made since my last visit. Agnes was very cheerful; and laughingly predicted that I should soon become too famous to be to, on such subjects. 'So I the most of the present time, you see,' said Agnes, 'and to you while I may.' As I at her beautiful face, observant of her she raised her mild clear eyes, and saw that I was at her. 'You are thoughtful today, Trotwood!' 'Agnes, shall I tell you what about? I came to tell you.' She put aside her as she was used to do when we were seriously discussing anything; and gave me her whole attention. 'My dear Agnes, do you doubt my being true to you?' 'No!' she answered, with a of astonishment. 'Do you doubt my being what I always have been to you?' 'No!' she answered, as before. 'Do you remember that I tried to tell you, when I came home, what a debt of gratitude I owed you, dearest Agnes, and how fervently I felt towards you?' 'I remember it,' she said, gently, 'very well.' 'You have a secret,' said I. 'Let me share it, Agnes.' She cast down her eyes, and trembled. 'I could hardly fail to even if I had not heard - but from other lips than yours, Agnes, which seems strange - that there is someone upon whom you have bestowed the treasure of your love. Do not shut me out of what concerns your happiness so nearly! If you can trust me, as you say you can, and as I you may, let me be your friend, your brother, in this matter, of all others!' With an appealing, almost a reproachful, glance, she rose from the window; and hurrying across the room as if without where, put her hands before her face, and burst into such tears as smote me to the heart. And yet they something in me, bringing promise to my heart. Without my why, these tears allied themselves with the quietly sad smile which was so fixed in my remembrance, and me more with hope than fear or sorrow. 'Agnes! Sister! Dearest! What have I done?' 'Let me go away, Trotwood. I am not well. I am not myself. I will to you by and by - another time. I will write to you. Don't to me now. Don't! don't!' I sought to recollect what she had said, when I had to her on that former night, of her affection needing no return. It seemed a very world that I must search through in a moment. 'Agnes, I cannot bear to see you so, and that I have been the cause. My dearest girl, dearer to me than anything in life, if you are unhappy, let me share your unhappiness. If you are in need of help or counsel, let me try to give it to you. If you have indeed a burden on your heart, let me try to lighten it. For whom do I live now, Agnes, if it is not for you!' 'Oh, spare me! I am not myself! Another time!' was all I could distinguish. Was it a selfish error that was leading me away? Or, having once a clue to hope, was there something opening to me that I had not dared to of? 'I must say more. I cannot let you leave me so! For Heaven's Agnes, let us not each other after all these years, and all that has come and gone with them! I must plainly. If you have any lingering thought that I could envy the happiness you will confer; that I could not resign you to a dearer protector, of your own choosing; that I could not, from my removed place, be a contented witness of your joy; dismiss it, for I don't deserve it! I have not suffered quite in vain. You have not taught me quite in vain. There is no alloy of self in what I feel for you.' She was quiet now. In a little time, she turned her pale face towards me, and said in a low voice, here and there, but very clear: 'I owe it to your pure friendship for me, Trotwood - which, indeed, I do not doubt - to tell you, you are I can do no more. If I have sometimes, in the course of years, wanted help and counsel, they have come to me. If I have sometimes been unhappy, the feeling has passed away. If I have ever had a burden on my heart, it has been lightened for me. If I have any secret, it is - no new one; and is - not what you suppose. I cannot reveal it, or divide it. It has long been mine, and must remain mine.' 'Agnes! Stay! A moment!' She was going away, but I detained her. I clasped my arm about her waist. 'In the course of years!' 'It is not a new one!' New thoughts and hopes were whirling through my mind, and all the colours of my life were changing. 'Dearest Agnes! Whom I so respect and honour - whom I so devotedly love! When I came here today, I thought that nothing could have wrested this confession from me. I thought I could have it in my bosom all our lives, till we were old. But, Agnes, if I have indeed any new-born hope that I may ever call you something more than Sister, widely different from Sister! -' Her tears fell fast; but they were not those she had lately shed, and I saw my hope brighten in them. 'Agnes! Ever my guide, and best support! If you had been more mindful of yourself, and less of me, when we grew up here together, I my heedless fancy never would have wandered from you. But you were so much better than I, so necessary to me in every boyish hope and disappointment, that to have you to confide in, and rely upon in everything, became a second nature, supplanting for the time the first and greater one of loving you as I do!' Still weeping, but not sadly - joyfully! And clasped in my arms as she had never been, as I had thought she never was to be! 'When I loved Dora - fondly, Agnes, as you -' 'Yes!' she cried, earnestly. 'I am glad to it!' 'When I loved her - even then, my love would have been incomplete, without your sympathy. I had it, and it was perfected. And when I lost her, Agnes, what should I have been without you, still!' Closer in my arms, nearer to my heart, her trembling hand upon my shoulder, her sweet eyes shining through her tears, on mine! 'I went away, dear Agnes, loving you. I stayed away, loving you. I returned home, loving you!' And now, I tried to tell her of the struggle I had had, and the conclusion I had come to. I tried to lay my mind before her, truly, and entirely. I tried to show her how I had hoped I had come into the better of myself and of her; how I had resigned myself to what that better brought; and how I had come there, even that day, in my fidelity to this. If she did so love me (I said) that she could me for her husband, she could do so, on no deserving of mine, except upon the truth of my love for her, and the trouble in which it had ripened to be what it was; and hence it was that I revealed it. And O, Agnes, even out of thy true eyes, in that same time, the spirit of my child-wife upon me, saying it was well; and winning me, through thee, to tenderest recollections of the Blossom that had withered in its bloom! 'I am so blest, Trotwood - my heart is so overcharged - but there is one thing I must say.' 'Dearest, what?' She laid her gentle hands upon my shoulders, and calmly in my face. 'Do you yet, what it is?' 'I am afraid to speculate on what it is. Tell me, my dear.' 'I have loved you all my life!' O, we were happy, we were happy! Our tears were not for the trials (hers so much the greater) through which we had come to be thus, but for the rapture of being thus, never to be divided more! We that winter evening, in the fields together; and the blessed calm within us seemed to be by the frosty air. The early stars began to shine while we were lingering on, and up to them, we our GOD for having guided us to this tranquillity. We stood together in the same old-fashioned window at night, when the moon was shining; Agnes with her quiet eyes raised up to it; I following her glance. Long miles of road then opened out before my mind; and, toiling on, I saw a ragged way-worn boy, and neglected, who should come to call even the heart now beating against mine, his own. It was nearly dinner-time next day when we appeared before my aunt. She was up in my study, Peggotty said: which it was her pride to in readiness and order for me. We found her, in her spectacles, sitting by the fire. 'Goodness me!' said my aunt, peering through the 'who's this you're bringing home?' 'Agnes,' said I. As we had arranged to say nothing at first, my aunt was not a little discomfited. She darted a hopeful glance at me, when I said 'Agnes'; but seeing that I as usual, she off her spectacles in despair, and rubbed her nose with them. She greeted Agnes heartily, nevertheless; and we were soon in the lighted parlour downstairs, at dinner. My aunt put on her spectacles twice or thrice, to another at me, but as often them off again, disappointed, and rubbed her nose with them. Much to the discomfiture of Mr. who this to be a bad symptom. 'By the by, aunt,' said I, after dinner; 'I have been to Agnes about what you told me.' 'Then, Trot,' said my aunt, turning scarlet, 'you did wrong, and your promise.' 'You are not angry, aunt, I trust? I am sure you won't be, when you learn that Agnes is not unhappy in any attachment.' 'Stuff and nonsense!' said my aunt. As my aunt appeared to be annoyed, I thought the best way was to cut her annoyance short. I Agnes in my arm to the of her chair, and we both leaned over her. My aunt, with one clap of her hands, and one through her spectacles, immediately went into hysterics, for the first and only time in all my of her. The hysterics called up Peggotty. The moment my aunt was restored, she flew at Peggotty, and calling her a silly old creature, hugged her with all her might. After that, she hugged Mr. (who was highly honoured, but a good deal surprised); and after that, told them why. Then, we were all happy together. I could not discover whether my aunt, in her last short conversation with me, had fallen on a pious fraud, or had really the state of my mind. It was quite enough, she said, that she had told me Agnes was going to be married; and that I now better than anyone how true it was. We were married within a fortnight. Traddles and Sophy, and Doctor and Mrs. Strong, were the only guests at our quiet wedding. We left them full of joy; and drove away together. Clasped in my embrace, I held the source of every worthy aspiration I had ever had; the centre of myself, the circle of my life, my own, my wife; my love of whom was founded on a 'Dearest husband!' said Agnes. 'Now that I may call you by that name, I have one thing more to tell you.' 'Let me hear it, love.' 'It grows out of the night when Dora died. She sent you for me.' 'She did.' 'She told me that she left me something. Can you what it was?' I believed I could. I drew the wife who had so long loved me, closer to my side. 'She told me that she made a last request to me, and left me a last charge.' 'And it was -' 'That only I would occupy this vacant place.' And Agnes laid her head upon my breast, and wept; and I wept with her, though we were so happy. CHAPTER 63 A VISITOR What I have purposed to record is nearly finished; but there is yet an incident conspicuous in my memory, on which it often rests with delight, and without which one thread in the web I have spun would have a ravelled end. I had advanced in fame and fortune, my domestic joy was perfect, I had been married ten happy years. Agnes and I were sitting by the fire, in our house in London, one night in spring, and three of our children were playing in the room, when I was told that a stranger wished to see me. He had been if he came on business, and had answered No; he had come for the pleasure of seeing me, and had come a long way. He was an old man, my servant said, and a farmer. As this sounded mysterious to the children, and moreover was the beginning of a favourite story Agnes used to tell them, introductory to the arrival of a old Fairy in a who hated everybody, it produced some commotion. One of our boys laid his head in his mother's lap to be out of harm's way, and little Agnes (our eldest child) left her doll in a chair to represent her, and thrust out her little heap of golden curls from between the window-curtains, to see what happened next. 'Let him come in here!' said I. There soon appeared, pausing in the doorway as he entered, a hale, grey-haired old man. Little Agnes, attracted by his had run to bring him in, and I had not yet clearly seen his face, when my wife, starting up, cried out to me, in a pleased and agitated voice, that it was Mr. Peggotty! It WAS Mr. Peggotty. An old man now, but in a ruddy, hearty, strong old age. When our first emotion was over, and he sat before the fire with the children on his and the blaze shining on his face, he to me, as vigorous and robust, withal as handsome, an old man, as ever I had seen. 'Mas'r Davy,' said he. And the old name in the old tone fell so naturally on my ear! 'Mas'r Davy, 'tis a joyful hour as I see you, once more, 'long with your own trew wife!' 'A joyful hour indeed, old friend!' cried I. 'And these heer pretty ones,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'To at these heer flowers! Why, Mas'r Davy, you was but the heighth of the littlest of these, when I first see you! When Em'ly warn't no bigger, and our poor lad were BUT a lad!' 'Time has changed me more than it has changed you since then,' said I. 'But let these dear rogues go to bed; and as no house in England but this must hold you, tell me where to send for your luggage (is the old bag among it, that went so far, I wonder!), and then, over a glass of Yarmouth grog, we will have the tidings of ten years!' 'Are you alone?' Agnes. 'Yes, ma'am,' he said, her hand, 'quite alone.' We sat him between us, not how to give him welcome enough; and as I began to listen to his old familiar voice, I could have fancied he was still pursuing his long journey in search of his darling niece. 'It's a mort of water,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'fur to come across, and on'y stay a matter of fower But water ('specially when 'tis salt) comes nat'ral to me; and friends is dear, and I am heer. - Which is verse,' said Mr. Peggotty, surprised to find it out, 'though I hadn't such intentions.' 'Are you going those many thousand miles, so soon?' Agnes. 'Yes, ma'am,' he returned. 'I giv the promise to Em'ly, afore I come away. You see, I doen't grow younger as the years comes round, and if I hadn't sailed as 'twas, most I shouldn't never have done 't. And it's allus been on my mind, as I must come and see Mas'r Davy and your own sweet blooming self, in your wedded happiness, afore I got to be too old.' He at us, as if he could never feast his eyes on us sufficiently. Agnes laughingly put some scattered of his grey hair, that he might see us better. 'And now tell us,' said I, 'everything relating to your fortunes.' 'Our fortuns, Mas'r Davy,' he rejoined, 'is soon told. We haven't fared nohows, but fared to thrive. We've allus thrived. We've as we ought to 't, and maybe we lived a leetle hard at first or so, but we have allus thrived. What with sheep-farming, and what with and what with one thing and what with t'other, we are as well to do, as well could be. Theer's been a blessing fell upon us,' said Mr. Peggotty, reverentially inclining his head, 'and we've done nowt but prosper. That is, in the long run. If not yesterday, why then today. If not today, why then tomorrow.' 'And Emily?' said Agnes and I, both together. 'Em'ly,' said he, 'arter you left her, ma'am - and I never heerd her saying of her prayers at night, t'other side the canvas screen, when we was settled in the Bush, but what I heerd your name - and arter she and me lost sight of Mas'r Davy, that theer shining sundown - was that low, at first, that, if she had then what Mas'r Davy from us so and thowtful, 'tis my opinion she'd have drooped away. But theer was some poor aboard as had illness among 'em, and she care of them; and theer was the children in our company, and she care of them; and so she got to be busy, and to be doing good, and that helped her.' 'When did she first hear of it?' I 'I it from her arter I heerd on 't,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'going on nigh a year. We was living then in a solitary place, but among the beautifullest trees, and with the roses a-covering our Beein to the roof. Theer come along one day, when I was out on the land, a traveller from our own or in England (I doen't rightly mind which), and of course we him in, and giv him to eat and and made him welcome. We all do that, all the colony over. He'd got an old newspaper with him, and some other account in print of the storm. That's how she it. When I came home at night, I found she it.' He dropped his voice as he said these words, and the gravity I so well remembered overspread his face. 'Did it change her much?' we 'Aye, for a good long time,' he said, his head; 'if not to this present hour. But I the solitoode done her good. And she had a deal to mind in the way of poultry and the and minded of it, and come through. I wonder,' he said thoughtfully, 'if you could see my Em'ly now, Mas'r Davy, whether you'd her!' 'Is she so altered?' I inquired. 'I doen't I see her ev'ry day, and doen't But, odd-times, I have thowt so. A slight figure,' said Mr. Peggotty, at the fire, worn; soft, sorrowful, blue eyes; a delicate face; a pritty head, leaning a little down; a quiet voice and way - timid a'most. That's Em'ly!' We silently observed him as he sat, still at the fire. 'Some he said, 'as her affection was ill-bestowed; some, as her marriage was off by death. No one how 'tis. She might have married well, a mort of times, \"but, uncle,\" she says to me, \"that's gone for ever.\" Cheerful along with me; retired when others is by; fond of going any distance fur to teach a child, or fur to tend a person, or fur to do some tow'rds a young girl's wedding (and she's done a many, but has never seen one); fondly loving of her uncle; patient; by young and old; sowt out by all that has any trouble. That's Em'ly!' He drew his hand across his face, and with a half-suppressed sigh up from the fire. 'Is Martha with you yet?' I 'Martha,' he replied, 'got married, Mas'r Davy, in the second year. A young man, a farm-labourer, as come by us on his way to with his mas'r's drays - a journey of over five hundred mile, theer and - made offers fur to her fur his wife (wives is very scarce theer), and then to set up fur their two selves in the Bush. She to me fur to tell him her trew story. I did. They was married, and they live fower hundred mile away from any voices but their own and the singing birds.' 'Mrs. Gummidge?' I suggested. It was a pleasant to touch, for Mr. Peggotty suddenly burst into a roar of laughter, and rubbed his hands up and down his legs, as he had been accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the boat. 'Would you believe it!' he said. 'Why, someun even made offer fur to marry her! If a ship's that was turning settler, Mas'r Davy, didn't offers fur to marry Missis Gummidge, I'm Gormed - and I can't say no fairer than that!' I never saw Agnes laugh so. This sudden ecstasy on the part of Mr. Peggotty was so delightful to her, that she could not leave off laughing; and the more she laughed the more she made me laugh, and the greater Mr. Peggotty's ecstasy became, and the more he rubbed his legs. 'And what did Mrs. Gummidge say?' I when I was grave enough. 'If you'll believe me,' returned Mr. Peggotty, 'Missis Gummidge, 'stead of saying you, I'm much obleeged to you, I ain't a-going fur to change my condition at my time of life,\" up'd with a as was standing by, and laid it over that theer ship's head 'till he sung out fur help, and I went in and of him.' Mr. Peggotty burst into a great roar of laughter, and Agnes and I both him company. 'But I must say this, for the good creetur,' he resumed, wiping his face, when we were quite exhausted; 'she has been all she said she'd be to us, and more. She's the willingest, the trewest, the honestest-helping woman, Mas'r Davy, as ever draw'd the breath of life. I have never her to be lone and lorn, for a single minute, not even when the colony was all afore us, and we was new to it. And of the old 'un is a thing she never done, I do assure you, since she left England!' 'Now, last, not least, Mr. Micawber,' said I. 'He has paid off every obligation he incurred here - even to Traddles's bill, you remember my dear Agnes - and therefore we may it for granted that he is doing well. But what is the latest news of him?' Mr. Peggotty, with a smile, put his hand in his and produced a flat-folded, paper parcel, from which he out, with much care, a little newspaper. 'You are to understan', Mas'r Davy,' said he, 'as we have left the Bush now, being so well to do; and have gone right away round to Port Middlebay Harbour, wheer theer's what we call a town.' 'Mr. Micawber was in the Bush near you?' said I. 'Bless you, yes,' said Mr. Peggotty, 'and turned to with a will. I never wish to meet a better gen'l'man for turning to with a will. I've seen that theer bald head of his a perspiring in the sun, Mas'r Davy, till I a'most thowt it would have melted away. And now he's a Magistrate.' 'A Magistrate, eh?' said I. Mr. Peggotty pointed to a certain paragraph in the newspaper, where I read aloud as follows, from the Port Middlebay Times: 'The public dinner to our distinguished fellow-colonist and townsman, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, Port Middlebay District Magistrate, came off yesterday in the large room of the Hotel, which was crowded to suffocation. It is estimated that not fewer than forty-seven persons must have been accommodated with dinner at one time, exclusive of the company in the passage and on the stairs. The beauty, fashion, and exclusiveness of Port Middlebay, to do honour to one so deservedly esteemed, so highly talented, and so widely popular. Doctor Mell (of Colonial Salem-House Grammar School, Port Middlebay) presided, and on his right sat the distinguished guest. After the removal of the cloth, and the singing of Non Nobis (beautifully executed, and in which we were at no loss to distinguish the notes of that gifted amateur, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, JUNIOR), the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and rapturously received. Doctor Mell, in a speech replete with feeling, then proposed \"Our distinguished Guest, the ornament of our town. May he never leave us but to better himself, and may his success among us be such as to render his bettering himself impossible!\" The cheering with which the toast was received defies description. Again and again it rose and fell,\n"
